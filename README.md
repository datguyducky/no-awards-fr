# üéñÔ∏è No awards for Reddit

> [!NOTE]
> 
> As of May 2024, this extension is back under development because Reddit has decided to reinstate awards (more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/1css0ws/we_heard_you_awards_are_back/)). With these changes, "No Awards for Reddit" has been updated accordingly. It no longer works for old Reddit, and the settings menu to disable/enable blocking awards in different places has been removed as currently awards are only displayed on posts and comments.

I'm sure I'm not the only one annoyed by the awards on Reddit. So I created this simple extension to completely hide them (on posts and comments), so if you would like to browse Reddit without them - **download** it from here:

-   [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-awards-for-reddit/)
-   [Google Chrome, Vivaldi, Opera, etc.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/no-awards-for-reddit/ehpnjdkpdllckhmbglbpdbmddcnloeep)

**TLDR:**

-   free and open-source
-   used daily by me, so if it stops working I will try to fix it ASAP
-   disable awards on posts and comments
-   hide "Give Awards" on comments and posts

## Hide awards on mobile

In the past, I was able to recommend a list of great unofficial apps for Reddit. However, due to recent "great" changes by Reddit, none of these apps are functional anymore. As a result, I‚Äôm not sure if it's still possible to avoid seeing awards on mobile.
