# üéñÔ∏è No awards for Reddit
This is a simple browser extension for Firefox and Chrome (coming soon) that hides all rewards from redesigned and old Reddit (on comments and posts).

Let me know if this extension stopped working, or if in some cases awards are properly hidden and in others not, so I can fix that.


## Hide awards on mobile
While I'm not available to make this work on mobile, there are a lot of **unofficial Reddit apps** for download and some of them have an option to hide awards, to name a few:

* Rif is fun [Android](https://www.play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit)
* Sync [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync)
* Boost [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubenmayayo.reddit) 
* Slide [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.ccrama.redditslide) & [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slide-for-reddit/id1260626828)
* Relay [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.reddit.news)
* Apollo [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id979274575)
* Comet [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1146204813)

***I'm not a developer of any of these apps, use this list only as a suggestion to which app to use. Not all of them may have an option to disable awards.***
